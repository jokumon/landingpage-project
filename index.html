            Why do we cry when it's the onions that are getting hurt? The Victorian had horse-drawn 
            buses, but you never see horses drawing anything these days. When did they lose their ability
            to draw? King Arthur came a lot didn't he? I think you mean he's associated with the court of Camelot.
            No, it definitely says here, 'King Arthur came a lot. Do we know if he came a lot. Or, like, just the
            same as the average man? The only evidence I have in that regard is that he said to have one child.
