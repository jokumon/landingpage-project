                        Why do we cry when it's the onions that are getting hurt? The Victorian had horse-drawn 
                        buses, but you never see horses drawing anything these days. When did they lose their ability
                        to draw?

                "It makes no sense. Are you fighting for humanity? Then, if anything, you should side with me. Your society has 'International Borders', partitions dividing the world into little boxes. To the right of a border, children starve to death. To the left, the idle dregs of mankind feast on excess. It is sheer madness. I will destroy all borders. I can give you, if not perfect equality, a better world"
